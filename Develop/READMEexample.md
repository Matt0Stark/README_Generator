## Installation
  Upon clicking on a cocktail from the search results, the user is presented a modal that shows the drinks name, image, list of ingredients, and instructions on how to prepare the cocktail. The user then has the option to save that drink to their favorites list which is stored into the browser's local storage. If the same drink is favorited more than once, that drink will be moved to the front of the favorites list but not added again.

## Usage
  The user has the option to navigate to their favorites list from the main page via the top right. If they do so, they are presented with all the cocktails they've favorited. From here they have the ability to access each cocktails modal again OR to remove the cocktail from their favorites. The user can also navigate back to the search page to find more wonderful cocktails to add to their collection.
